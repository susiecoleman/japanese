## Introductions

```
Hajimemashite
Susie desu
yoroshiku onegaishimas
```

Introducing yourself, formal introduction. Don't have to just limit to stating your name could also list things like occupation and nationality. [Explanation](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/yoroshiku-onegaishimasu-meaning/) on why this is hard to translate exactly.

In the context of this introduction you are telling them about yourself so it should technically be:

```
Hajimemashite
watashi wa Susie desu
yoroshiku onegaishimas
```

But the watashi wa can be dropped

When re-introducing yourself you can just use

```
watashi wa Susie desu
```

I am Susie

## Addressing Others

People should be addressed as:

```
[Their name] san
e.g.
Susie san
```

## Noun Sentences

```
[X] wa [Y] desu
```

Where X is the topic and Y is the information. It lets you know I'm going to tell you something about X. e.g.

```
watashi wa nihon jin desu
I am Japanese
watashi wa enjinia desu
```

This also works with names to talk about other people

```
Kate san wa amarika jin desu
```

## Asking and Answering Questions

Take the noun sentence and add `ka` to the end.

```
Susie san wa enjinia desu ka
Susie is an engineer?
Mike san wa Igirisu jin desu ka
Mike is English?
```

Yes - `Hai`

No - `Iie`

```
Hai, Burajiru jin desu
Yes I am/they are Brazilian

Mary san wa Furansu jin desu
Iie, Furansu jin ja arimasen, igirisu jin desu
No they are/I'm not French I'm British
```

This pattern is for all noun sentences.

## Also

The noun sentence

```
[X] wa [Y] desu
```

wa is replaced by mo to say too/also. This can also be used in a question.

```
Susie san wa Enginia desu
Emma san mo Enginia desu
or to shorten it
Susie san wa Enginia desu
Emma san mo desu
```

Susie is an engineer, Emma is also an Engineer.

## Connecting Nouns

```
[X] no [Y]
```

This is to say that Y belongs to X. It's equivalent to `'s`

```
The Guardian no Enginia
The Guardian's Engineer
Citylit no Kyoshi
Citylit's teacher
```

This is how to say where you work/belong to. If you are a company employee `kaishain` if you specify the company it becomes `shain`

```
Watashi wa Sony no shain desu
Watashi wa The Guardian no enginia desu.
```

I am an employee of Sony
I am an engineer for The Guardian.
